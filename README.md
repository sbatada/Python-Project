Salima Python Project - Gun Deaths in US Data Analysis


In this project, I have analyzed data on gun deaths in the US between 2012-2014. 

The dataset is from FiveThirtyEight and is stored in guns.csv file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim. 

The census.csv file contains detailed US demographic data and is joined with the guns.csv data to get a better understanding of gun deaths by race by taking into account the total population data by race.

In this project, I have explored the dataset to find patterns in the demographics of the victims. The python commands and data analysis is available in the Basics.ipynb file available in the master folder.

The steps performed are listed below:
* Loaded data from guns.csv file to a list.
* Excluded headers from the list.
* Created disctionary to show deaths by grouped by year, year/month, race and sex.
* Added a second dataset to calculate gun death rates by race.
* Calculated gun deaths by race where intent was Homicide.
* Data Analysis findings summarized
 

Enjoy :-)
