Salima Python Project


In this project, I have analyzed data on gun deaths in the US. 

The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight, and is stored in the guns.csv file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim. 

In this project, I have explored the dataset to find patterns in the demographics of the victims. The python commands and data analysis is available in the Basics.ipynb file available in the master folder.

Enjoy :-)
